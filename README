All API Methods Implemented So Far: Check sample.php for code sample

$dns = new rackDNS($rs_user,$rs_api_key); //($user, $key, $endpoint = 'UK') $endpoint can be UK or US

// Show all domains avalible
$dns->list_domains(50,0); //($limit = 10, $offset = 0)

$dns->list_subdomains($sampleID);//($domainID)

$dns->domain_export($sampleID);//($domainID)

$dns->list_records($sampleID);//($domainID)

$dns->list_record_details($sampleID,$recID);//($domainID,$recordID)

$dns->domain_import($sampleImport);

$dns->list_domain_search('domain.com');

$dns->modify_domain($sampleID,'info@domain.com'); //($domainID = false , $email = false , $ttl = 86400 , $comment = 'Modify Domain Using rackDNS API')

$dns->delete_domains($sampleID);

$dns->delete_domain_record($domainID,$recordID)

$dns->list_domain_details($domainID = false, $showRecords = false, $showSubdomains = false);


$dns->import_domain('domain.com');

$dns->create_domain($name = false, $email = false, $records = array());

$dns->create_domain_record($domainID = false, $records = array());

$dns->create_domain_record_helper($type = false, $name = false, $data = false, $ttl = 86400, $priority = false);

$dns->getLastResponseStatus(); //returns status code
$dns->getLastResponseMessage();//returns status message
